# Branching Strategy

The branching strategy used for this projects is [Scaled Trunk-Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/#scaled-trunk-based-development) where we have a main branch called trunk and the developers work in feature branches that eventually are integrated to the trunk.

## Branch naming convention

### Branch categories

- feat: for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
- bugfix: for fixing a bug
- hotfix: for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process(because an emergency)
- test: for testing purposes
- refac: for refactor code

Branch name structure: {branch-category}/{description-separated-with-dashes}
